# Project proposal

## Definition.
We need to develop a software that, given an image, it retrieves from the image dataset the most relevant images. We will develop this using convolutional neural networks, more specifically, fine-tuning the ResNet50 CNN with our self-constructed dataset, although we will consider adding more images to the dataset as the project progresses.

## Preliminary plan of work.
We will perform fine-tuning on the ResNet50 CNN with our dataset. For that we will use the TensorFlow library, as well as numpy



















You should write a short text outlining your project and submit it in STUDIS. The text should be concise and technical. Write as short text as possible, but be as specific as possible. Please, do not exceed single A4 page. Feel free to include diagrams, lists, ... Include references to methods, datasets, papers, tutorials and libraries when appropriate. The text should include:

Your definition of the project task - how you understand it and what is the exact scope you want to solve in the project.
Preliminary plan of work: General approach, methods, software, tools, tutorials? Specify existing components you'd like to use and outline the work you intend to do yourself. How will each team member contribute to the project?
Evaluation plan: What dataset you want to use and why is it suitable? What is the evaluation metric? Include one existing result on the dataset for reference.
